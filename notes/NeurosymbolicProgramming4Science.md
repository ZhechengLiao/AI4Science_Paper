# Neurosymbolic Programming for Science

NP techniques can accelerate scientific discovery.
Easy to learn complex pattern by combing neuron and symbolic.

Intro
----
Problem: hard to find AI scientist(design, test, and infer)
Because:
- AI doesn't have prior knowledge.
- interpretable 

NP techniques can help to solve above problems.
1. build incorporate prior knowledge
2. strong constraint on model behavior and structure

How?
use neurosymbolic programming to represent scientific hypothesis(Domain specific language). 

Process:
Data curation -> encoding domain knowlegde -> NP Model training -> evaluation (iteratively)
main: domain knowledge
